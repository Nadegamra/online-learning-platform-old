## Launch instructions
### General requirements
- Having docker installed on the device
### Backend
#### Requirements
- Having an email (for sending Authentication service emails)
- Having a Google Drive API Service Account (for storing course images)
#### Instructions
- Create auth_dev.env file inside `./Backend` directory. It should contain these environment variables:
  - Smtp__EmailAddress (Email address from which to send account confirmation emails, etc.)
  - Smtp__EmailPass (If you are using gmail, you should generate an App Password, but this could differ according to email provider)
  - Smtp__TestEmail (Used for testing. Email to which all mail is redirected, leave empty to turn off this functionality)
- Get a Google Drive API Service Account json key, rename it to `key.json` and place inside the `./Backend/Services/CourseManagement/` directory
- Execute `dotnet ef database update` in `./Backend/Services/Authentication` and `./Backend/Services/CourseManagement`
- Execute `docker-compose up` from `./Backend` directory
### Frontend
#### Instructions
- Execute `docker-compose up` from `./Frontend` directory
